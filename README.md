## Overview
Connecting multiple neurons and popular backpropagation algorithm to build a powerful Neural Network architecture to solve complex problem,
to be more specific, Handwritten Recognition. Furthermore, OpenCV library is also applied for processing real-time Handwritten image in order to create data for the MLP model to predict the label (0-9) digits.
